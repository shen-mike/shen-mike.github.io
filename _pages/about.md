I am a second year graduate student in the [Pharmacology and Neuroscience PhD program](https://www.creighton.edu/medicine/departments/pharmacology-neuroscience) at Creighton University in Omaha, Nebraska, where I work primarily at the [Cognitive and Sensory Imaging Laboratory](https://www.instituteforhumanneuroscience.org/casi-lab), under the direction of [Dr. Heinrichs-Graham](https://www.instituteforhumanneuroscience.org/elizabeth-heinrichs-graham), as part of the [Institute for Human Neuroscience](https://www.instituteforhumanneuroscience.org/) at [Boys Town National Research Hospital](https://www.boystownresearch.org/).

As I progress through my graduate school career, more updates will be posted here!
